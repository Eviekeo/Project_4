# Insurance - Claim Processing Durations

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a website where users could input certain variables (distribution channel and insurance cover type), which would then provide the user with a list of insurance providers in order of which provider could process a claim more efficiently. 

The goal was to assist users in their search for the best insurer to obtain cover from.

## Data processing
- Target variable: `Value`
- Feature variables: `Company Name`, `Channel Type` and `Cover Type` 


#### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
